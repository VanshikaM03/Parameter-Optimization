# SVM Optimization on Multi-Class Dataset

This project aims to optimize Support Vector Machine (SVM) for a multi-class dataset from the UCI library. The dataset size ranges from 5k to 30k rows and is divided into 70-30 for training and testing with 10 different samples. SVM is optimized for every sample with 100 iterations, and the best parameters are reported. The convergence graph is plotted for the sample with the maximum accuracy. The complete results, including basic data analytics of the selected dataset, are showcased on GitHub.

## Dataset

The selected dataset is [insert dataset name here] from the UCI library. It contains [insert brief description of the dataset].

## Methodology

1. **Dataset Preparation**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split.
2. **SVM Optimization**: SVM is optimized for every sample using 100 iterations.
3. **Parameter Tuning**: The best parameters for SVM are determined for each sample.
4. **Results**: The results, including accuracy and best parameters, are reported for each sample.
5. **Convergence Graph**: A convergence graph is plotted for the sample with the maximum accuracy.

## Results

The project results can be found in the [results folder](link to results folder) on GitHub. The results include:

- Accuracy and best parameters for each sample
- Convergence graph for the sample with the maximum accuracy
- Basic data analytics of the selected dataset

## Usage

To replicate the results, follow these steps:
